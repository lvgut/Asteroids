# Asteroids
## Description 

Asteroids is a game developed using pygame, where you play as a satellite orbiting earth. The objective is to shoot asteroids that are 
approaching so that they do not hit earth. You have a limit of 5 lives, at which point the game ends. The asteroids are based on NASA's data on near-earth objects, with dates that they appeared in the top left corner of the screen.
